File descriptions:
main.c: filecount shall recursively gather frequency statistics 
 	of all regular files (i.e., no directories) in
        the directory tree rooted at startdir.
flatten.c: for a command line utility flatten path 
	that operates on the directory hierarchy rooted at path.
dirwalk.h: go throw each file in a given directory and pass back a path to the called function
	this function is used in main.c and flatten.c
file_info.h: stores all the neccesary information needed for displaying a histogram
filecount: executable file
flatten: executable file
questions.odt: answering follow-up questions

How to run the program:
1. filecount:
run ./filecount [startdir]
If startdir is specified, then the count shall begin in that directory, should it exist; if not specified,
then the current working directory will be used.

2. flatten:
run ./flatten path that operates on the directory hierarchy rooted at path.
